This is a practice repository for commonly asked Leetcode problems in coding interviews. There are many lists out there like [blind75](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions), which will help you in  understanding the kind of questions that are commonly asked in interviews but I am using a list from the following [website](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/). The problems from blind75 may be repeated in previous list.

I plan to code all the solutions in Java to solve the problems in the list and add the solutions on daily basis.
